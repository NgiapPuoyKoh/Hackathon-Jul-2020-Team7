# Let's Go

This is a website designed to help older and more vulnerable people stay connected and thrive during the new normal. It allows those who are less technologically minded to take advantage of internet.

It is broken down into 4 pages:
Let's Move - Provides embedded workout videos to help get users moving
Let's Learn - A way of learning a new skill to keep users thinking at home
Let's Explore - A way of seeing the world from the comfort of your own home
Family - A series of videos teaching users how to use software and websites designed to keep users connected such as social media

## Deployment

Let's Go has been deployed to github pages and is accessible [here](https://ngiappuoykoh.github.io/Hackathon-Jul-2020-Team7/)

## UX

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to continue to talk to my friends and family while staying safe and social distancing
- As a user, I want to learn new things while I am cocooning
- As a user, I want to see beautiful parts of the world from my home
- As a user, I want to stay active in interesting and new ways

The Let's Go Website achieves this by

- Providing users with informative videos of how to use the best communication tools out there such as Zoom and whatsapp. It also teaches users how to set up and use their social media, all of which helps users remain connected.
- Providing handy links to guides on cooking various meals. There is enough variety that there is going to be something the user hasn't tried.
- Allowing the user to see the world through other peoples eyes, showing video and interactive footage of museums and the great outdoors.
- Showing users through videos, new and interesting ways to stay fit. These videos show step by step what the user can do or will do the workout with them.

### User Experience

The site is built for ease of use for those that are less technologically minded such as the elderly.

Bright contrasting colours are used to show different sections of the screen so that it is clear which section you are heading for.

Let's go has been designed to be used on any screen size, with a particular focus on tablets as this is what we assume the main user base will access the site from.

The process of designing the website began with team members providing wireframes of their thoughts for the site. The best features of the wireframes were voting on and used for the website. Wireframes are available to view [here](https://github.com/NgiapPuoyKoh/Hackathon-Jul-2020-Team7/tree/master/wireframes). An example is shown:

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

### Languages and Frameworks

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Bootstrap

### Tools Used

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): Used to create wireframes
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/): IDE used for creating and editing code
- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#): Used for site testing at various screen sizes

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
